[Metamask](https://metamask.io) is one of the most (if not the most) widely used non-custodial cryptocueency wallets that is compatible with _Web3_ and _Ethereum-like_ (_EVM-based_) networks. Therefore, it supports all networks that are forks of the main Ethereum blockchain (For a complete list, readers can check live maintained lists, such as [ChainList](https://chainlist.org). We note that it is not an advertisement for any of the chains listed in the given link and users must add networks to their Metamsk wallet at their own risk).

## Installation

### Step 5
Read and accept the Terms of Use, and click ‘Create’ once your password has been set.
An introduction video of Metamask will appear. You can watch or skip, and click “Next”.
MetaMask will then present you with your 12-word backup phrase. To see the Secret Backup Phrase, click the “Click Here to Reveal Secret Words”.
:::note
 This phrase will be needed to recover your wallet should you ever lose access to your computer, and should be kept stored somewhere safe. Anybody who has access to your 12-word backup phrase will have access to the funds in your MetaMask wallet, so keep it private.

Click ‘Next’ once you’ve written this down.
